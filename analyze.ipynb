      "A: Relational algebra does not inherently support decimal data types or operations. It primarily deals with set operations on relations. However, if your database schema includes decimal values (like salary), you can perform operations on them, such as comparisons or calculations, as part of relational expressions. For example, you can filter based on decimal values using conditions like `σ salary > 50000 (Emp)`. The actual representation and handling of decimals would depend on the database system that implements relational algebra.\n"

The instructor may announce different dates and the bonus may not apply to all labs, so pay attention to class announcements. For example, September 30th is a holiday, so the deadline for a 10% bonus for lab 3 is Tuesday, October 1st. You must attend a help session and show a TA or instructor to get the bonus. The bonus does not apply for early submission on Canvas. This policy is in place to encourage interaction with the TAs/instructor, provide real-time feedback to help learning, and reduce procrastination to allow students to perform their best.\n"
