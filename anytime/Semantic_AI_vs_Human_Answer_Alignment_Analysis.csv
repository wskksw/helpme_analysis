0,Lab 6 Bonus Deadline,"To determine the Lab 6 bonus deadline, check the class announcements for any specific dates mentioned. Remember that bonus marks typically depend on showing your work to a TA before certain deadlines, and it's important to verify if any exceptions apply to Lab 6.","The lab is due on Nov 1. Consequently, the deadline for a 10% bonus is Oct 28, and the deadline for a 5% bonus is Oct 30. You can find the assignment due dates on Canvas."
1,Course Mark,"You may not be able to see your total weighted grade directly on Canvas, but you can calculate it using the grading components provided. Consider how each section contributes to your overall grade, such as the labs worth 20% and quizzes worth 10%. Check if your course provides a breakdown of marks, and if not, try calculating it by applying the respective weights to your scores.","No – calculation of total grades is disabled for students on Canvas. However, the marking scheme is available [in the syllabus](https://github.com/rlawrenc/cosc_304/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#marking-and-evaluation), so you can use that to approximate your final grade if necessary."
2,Lab 5 Bonus,"To find the deadline for the bonus for Lab 5, you'll want to check the class announcements, as the specific dates may vary. Remember, showing a TA before Monday at 4 p.m. gives a 10% bonus, while before Wednesday at 4 p.m. gives a 5% bonus. Make sure to confirm the exact date for Lab 5 based on when it is assigned!","Bonus deadline for lab 5 is Tuesday, October 15th at 4 p.m. Note that the marking for this take time (5 to 10 minutes) so please plan ahead."
3,Incorrect Link,"It seems that the link you are trying to access for Lab 7 bonus marks is not working. A good approach would be to check for any announcements or updates on Canvas regarding the lab or bonus features. Additionally, you could explore alternative resources provided in the course material or consult with your classmates to see if anyone has accessed the content. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to your instructor or the course help page for assistance.","You're right — the redirect is broken. Sorry about that. You can access the page by adding the missing slash in the redirect or by clicking the URL below.  
<https://s342.ok.ubc.ca/rlawrenc/tomcat/Lab7/bonus/shop.html>"
4,Final Project Questions,"Think about the project paths mentioned in the context. Each stream has specific requirements, and you should consider whether you have the flexibility to choose your own data or if you need to stick to a provided database. Review the project guidelines to clarify this aspect.","For lab 10 and the final deliverable, you can modify the database however you want. It is expected that you will replace the sample data with information about the products you will sell at your particular store."
8,Final Question,"It's important to remember that during an exam, you can only use approved materials. Since Google Docs is not allowed, downloading notes from there as a PDF would still fall under the category of non-approved resources. Consider reviewing your course materials and creating your own notes on paper instead, if it's a closed book exam. Would you like any tips on how to prepare your notes?","Yes, you can download any notes on your computer to use locally including documents produced on Google Docs."
9,lab 2 db,"To resolve the ""No database selected"" error, you need to choose a database before creating a table. From the databases listed (testuser, workson, university), refer to the lab instructions or any specific requirements mentioned in your lab 2 assignment. Typically, you might want to use either ""workson"" or ""mydb"" as they are likely designed for your assignments. To select a database, use the command `USE workson;` or `USE mydb;`. Then try creating your table again.","To resolve the ""No database selected"" error, you need to choose a database before creating a table. From the databases listed (testuser, workson, university), refer to the lab instructions or any specific requirements mentioned in your lab 2 assignment. Typically, you might want to use either ""workson"" or ""mydb"" as they are likely designed for your assignments. To select a database, use the command `USE workson;` or `USE mydb;`. Then try creating your table again.

You can use either workson or mydb for lab 2."
10,Lab 6 Missing Files,It seems like you're referring to a specific file needed for your lab work. You might want to double-check the course's GitHub repository or ask your instructor directly during office hours if the file was indeed provided or if there was an oversight. Remember to look for any updates or announcements regarding the lab materials as well.,Good job starting right away! I was in the process of modifying the GitHub repo. All Python files should now be visible.
11,Question 16: Using Views & Triggers,"To address whether Joe can update employees in departments with more than 3 employees using views and triggers, consider the following hints:

1. **Views Limitation**: Views are typically used for presenting data and may not provide the necessary filtering for updates based on conditions like employee count.

2. **INSTEAD OF Triggers**: While using an INSTEAD OF trigger can allow updates on views, it generally executes its own SQL statements instead of the user's command. This means that the trigger would need to include logic to restrict updates to only those employees in departments with more than 3 employees.

3. **Complexity**: Implementing such logic in a trigger can be complex and may not directly enforce Joe's access restrictions based solely on the view.

Reflect on these points to determine if combining views and triggers can achieve the intended result.","I like your thinking on this. The answer on the exam is ""No"" as the view (query) to determine the employees in departments that have more than three employees would require a join, grouping, and aggregation. That would make the query not updateable. It would be possible to query that view though and only provide read only access.

Now the question is if you could somehow construct a view using INSTEAD OF and triggers/custom code to make this happen. Well, I guess anything is possible. With the INSTEAD OF, you could intercept the original update command and then determine if the user 'Joe' should be able to update that employee based on the criteria. 

Note however the key point is that as a developer you will be writing all this custom code and implementing your own security policies in code. That is NEVER a good idea. So maybe the best explanation is you cannot enforce the update security restriction using built-in GRANT/REVOKE commands only because that particular view is not updateable."
12,Lab 5 Astah Use,"It seems you're looking for guidance on using AstahUML for your assignment. A good starting point would be to check if there are any specific resources or guidelines provided in your course material on Canvas. Additionally, consider looking for tutorials that focus on the types of diagrams you might need for Lab 5. If you're still uncertain, you might want to ask your instructor or classmates for their input on which diagram types are most relevant for your assignment.","For AstahUML, you will use the Class Diagram to draw the UML diagram that we are using for database design."
13,PrairieLearn LV 14.7 and 14.8 ,"For your questions about the queries and their results in LVL 14.7 and 14.8, here are some hints to consider:

1. **LVL 14.7**: Make sure that your `SELECT` statements are correctly structured and that the `JOIN` conditions are valid. Also, check if there are any typos in the column names or table aliases, as these can cause the query to return unexpected results.

2. **LVL 14.8**: Ensure that the `EXCEPT` clause is being used correctly and that both `SELECT` statements return compatible columns. Remember that `EXCEPT` will return rows from the first query that are not in the second.

Double-check your query syntax and the structure of your tables and columns. If the logic is sound but it's still grading incorrectly, there may be specific grading criteria or additional context in the assignment that you need to review.",Both queries are correct. I have manually modified your grade as the PL update fix for these questions does not work if the question has already been started. Good work on these questions.
14,Where do I find the practice final exam? ,"It sounds like you've done some good searching already! If you can see the answer files in the 'Modules' section, there may indeed be a practice final exam available. I recommend checking other sections within 'Modules' for any labeled resources regarding the practice exam itself. It might be under a different subheading or folder. If you still can't find it, consider reaching out to your instructor for clarification. Keep up the good work!",The practice final exam is in the Quizzes section on Canvas (on the bottom of the page). Here is a [direct link to the practice final exam](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/150492/quizzes/790022).
15,Answer for Lab 1,"It seems like you're asking about the potential discrepancy between the expected output image for Lab 1 and the actual result of the query. To clarify this, consider whether the query you wrote could return more rows than those shown in the image. 

Here are a few hints to guide you:

1. **Review the Query**: Look closely at the conditions specified in your SQL query. Are there any filters (like `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, etc.) that might limit the results?

2. **Check the Data**: Make sure to examine the data in the relevant tables carefully. Are there any entries that meet the query's criteria but are not represented in the image?

3. **Understand Grouping**: If your query involves grouping, remember that it could condense multiple rows into a single result based on the grouping criteria. 

By considering these factors, you should be able to determine if the image contains all the rows or if there might be more based on your query.",The Lab 1 results are displaying all the rows in the expected output.
16,Team Members,"It's understandable that finding a partner in a large class can be challenging. One suggestion is to reach out through class discussion forums or group chats to express that you're looking for a partner. You might also consider attending any class events or study sessions where you can meet fellow students who are also seeking partners. This way, you can connect with those who might be in the same situation as you. Remember to adhere to the collaboration guidelines when forming your team!",Please post in the Canvas discussion. I have also made this question public in case others are looking for a partner.
17,midterm materials confirmation,"To confirm the materials for Midterm Exam #2, you should refer to the course outline or announcements on Canvas. Typically, midterms cover specific lectures, so checking the syllabus can provide clarity on which lectures are included.

The details are posted on Canvas: https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/150492/discussion_topics/2388954
18,Docker Desktop wont run on my laptop,"It sounds like you're encountering compatibility issues with Docker Desktop on your Windows 10 laptop. Here are a few hints to troubleshoot the problem: 

1. **Check System Requirements**: Ensure that your version of Windows 10 is compatible with Docker Desktop. You may need Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise for full support.

2. **Enable Virtualization**: Make sure that virtualization is enabled in your BIOS settings. This is necessary for Docker to run smoothly.

3. **Consider WSL 2**: If you're not already using it, consider enabling Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2, as Docker Desktop can leverage this for improved compatibility.

4. **Reinstall Docker**: Sometimes, a fresh installation can resolve issues. Ensure to completely uninstall Docker Desktop and then reinstall it.

5. **Consult Documentation**: Check the official Docker documentation for any troubleshooting tips specific to Windows 10.

If you continue to experience issues, it might be helpful to reach out to your course's help desk for further assistance.","This error usually means that you need to enable WSL2 or Hyper-V on your computer. You can find instructions for doing this on Docker's website: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/#system-requirements You should also ensure that you downloaded the AMD64 installer instead of the ARM64 installer. (Note that you might need the ARM64 installer if your system is ARM-based, but that is unlikely unless you are using a Copilot+ PC.)
If none of that fixes this issue, consider joining the office hours, and we might be able to sort it out."
19,midterm format,"For your question about writing relational algebra symbols for selections and projections, remember that you'll typically use specific symbols to represent these operations. 

- For selection (σ), you would use the sigma symbol followed by a condition in parentheses.
- For projection (π), you would use the pi symbol followed by the attributes you want to keep in parentheses.

Make sure you're familiar with the formatting for both operations as well as how to combine them. It might be helpful to practice writing a few expressions based on the examples you have. Would you like some hints on how to approach the practice midterm questions?",Relational algebra symbols such as selection (σ) and projection (π) can be copied from using the relational algebra editor in either PrairieLearn or Relax.
20,Automark ER diagram on Midterm,It’s a good idea to check the exam guidelines or ask your instructor directly about specific features like auto-marking on PrairieLearn for the midterm. They would provide the most accurate information regarding exam procedures. Make sure to review your ER diagram concepts before the exam!,The ER diagram is auto-marked on PL. **You are limited to at most 5 submission attempts.**
21,Are there in person office hours,"The context provided does not mention in-person office hours explicitly. Therefore, I cannot confirm their availability based on the given information.","Good question. There are no in person labs, except for Dr. Lawrence's office hours on Thursday, where you could join via Zoom or in person. The location is Sci 200C"
22,"Prairie Learn ""broken submission due to error in question code"" ","It seems you are experiencing an issue with code submission in PrairieLearn. Make sure to double-check the following:

1. **Syntax Errors**: Ensure there are no syntax issues in the code you copied over from relaX.
2. **Compatibility**: Confirm that the code is compatible with PrairieLearn's expected format and requirements.
3. **Testing**: Run tests locally before submitting to ensure it behaves as expected.
4. **Documentation**: Refer to PrairieLearn documentation for any specific guidelines or limitations.

If the problem persists, consider reaching out to your instructor or tech support for further assistance.","If you are able to get the output correct, please ignore any automarking issues with PrairieLearn. The assignment is verified by the TAs or instructor when marking. Note also that some answers have different ordering that is also correct and will be marked incorrect by PL."
24,Why is this a wrong statement,"The statement ""ON UPDATE CASCADE will modify all rows in the primary key table when a value is modified in the foreign key table"" is incorrect. 

Hint: Consider what happens to the foreign key when an update occurs in the primary key table. What does ""CASCADE"" mean in this context?","This statement is incorrect because the ON UPDATE CASCADE action causes a foreign key to be updated when the primary key it references is updated — not the other way around.
You can find information about referential actions in MySQL's documentation: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table-foreign-keys.html"
25,Prairie LV13.4. Consulting department projects,"It looks like you're on the right track with your query, but the error indicates that the table ""proj"" might not exist in your database. Here are a couple of hints to help you troubleshoot:

1. **Check Table Names**: Make sure that the table names you're using match exactly what is in your database schema. Sometimes, they might be named slightly differently (e.g., ""projects"" instead of ""proj"").

2. **Review Table Structure**: If you have access, you can view the structure of the tables to confirm the correct names and their relationships.

3. **Join Condition**: Ensure that the columns you are joining on (like `dno` in your case) are correctly referenced and exist in both tables.

Try checking those aspects, and you might be able to resolve the issue!",I ran it just now on prairie learn again and it worked. Can you check again and verify?
26,Prairie Learn LV5.12. Loans larger than a deposit account,"It looks like you're trying to write a query to find customer names along with their loan and deposit amounts, specifically for those who have a loan larger than their deposit at the same branch. 

Here are some hints to guide you:

1. **Join Tables**: Make sure you are correctly joining the `borrow` and `deposit` tables based on both the customer name and the branch name. This ensures that you're comparing loans and deposits from the same customer at the same branch.

2. **Filter Condition**: Use a selection (σ) to filter the results where the loan amount is greater than the deposit balance.

3. **Projection**: Finally, when projecting (π) your result, ensure you include the correct attributes: customer name (cname), loan amount (amount), and deposit balance (balance).

By addressing these areas, you should be able to refine your query to get the desired results!","You do not need to join with customer as you have customer name in the borrow relation.

π borrow.cname,borrow.amount,deposit.balance (σ borrow.amount > deposit.balance (deposit ⨝ deposit.cname = borrow.cname and deposit.bname=borrow.bname borrow))"
27,Lab 3,All AI uses have been used up for today. Please try again tomorrow.,It is likely that the DDL files used to create the sample database were not present when you started Docker.

32,"I cannot log into the database at all, why? It was running 10 min ago","It looks like you're encountering a login issue with the database. Here are a few hints to help you troubleshoot:

1. **Database Availability**: Make sure the 'orders' database is online and accessible. If it was running 10 minutes ago, check if it might have gone offline or if there were any changes to its status.

2. **Connection URL**: Double-check the connection URL to ensure that the server name and port are correct. The format looks good, but verify that there are no typos.

3. **User Permissions**: Ensure that the user 'sa' has the appropriate permissions to access the 'orders' database. Sometimes, permissions can be altered or revoked.

4. **Password**: Confirm that the password is correct and hasn't changed since you last logged in successfully.

5. **Firewall or Network Issues**: If you're accessing the database remotely, check for any firewall rules or network issues that might be preventing the connection.

Try these steps to diagnose the problem further!","Your credentials are correct — it seems that the `orders` database does not exist. In that case, you can apply the DDL manually using the instructions in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT3v29Zg5IQ&list=PLNy6MJ_mI2wVhDpCnJNWdBIOmXXmcR3i_&index=4).

What does the exam policy specify for your midterm?",You should not need the Java documentation for the midterm. All of the material you would need is in the notes or sample code.
36,Analysis Lab 10 Typo?,"It seems like there might be a misunderstanding regarding the years in your project features. I suggest reviewing the instructions for both Lab 8 and Lab 10 to clarify what is expected. Pay attention to any patterns in the years mentioned and think about how they relate to the topics covered in each lab. If you're still unsure, consider discussing it with a classmate or reaching out to your TA for confirmation.","The TAs will accept predictions for either 2023+2024 or 2024+2025. If you predict for 2023+2024, you would use the complete data for 2020 to 2022, which is a little easier than doing 2024+2025. If you predict for 2024+2025, you need to have a technique for completing the last 2 months of the 2023 data before you do the prediction. In lab 8, we simply increased 2023 numbers by 20%, but there are other assumptions that you could make."
37,ReLaX and XML Practice Query Page Exam Usage,"To confirm whether you can use the ReLaX editor and XML practice query page on the final, I recommend checking your course syllabus or any announcements from your instructor regarding exam guidelines.

Based on the context, it's important to clarify whether the questions will be presented through PrairieLearn or if they will require hand-drawn diagrams. For the format, think about how previous exams were conducted and whether similar methods might be used again. 

As for drawing them, consider if you have been provided any specific guidelines on the medium for submissions. It might be helpful to check with your instructor for any explicit instructions regarding this. Would you like to further explore what you might need to prepare for the exam?",The ER question will be on PrairieLearn for the final exam.
54,Can we use db fiddle for sql questions?,You can definitely use tools like DB Fiddle to practice SQL questions. It allows you to write and test SQL queries in a simulated environment. Have you tried exploring its features or creating a sample database there?,You can definitely use tools like DB Fiddle to practice SQL questions.
55,Can we Use Microsoft Word,"For your exam, remember that the rules state you can only use personal notes on paper for closed book exams. Since Microsoft Word is a digital resource, it wouldn't be allowed. Consider transferring your notes to a printed format to comply with the exam guidelines.",You can use Microsoft Word to view your notes. They do not need to be PDFs.
56,Here is my docker file for reference,"It looks like you're working with a Docker setup for both MySQL and SQL Server. To better understand your Docker file, consider the following hints:

1. **Services Section**: Each service (like `cosc304-mysql` and `cosc304-sqlserver`) defines a specific database setup. Pay attention to the environment variables for each database, as they set essential parameters like passwords and initial databases.

2. **Volumes**: The volumes section is crucial for data persistence. Notice how the databases are set to store their data on the host machine, which means that even if the containers are stopped, the data remains available.

3. **Networks**: The `networks` section indicates how services communicate with each other. Think about how these aliases might help in connecting your application to the databases.

4. **Command for SQL Server**: The command section for `cosc304-sqlserver` is a bit more complex. It handles waiting for the SQL Server to be ready before executing any scripts. Understanding this part will help you know how to manage service dependencies.

5. **MySQL Connection**: When you connect to MySQL, remember to look for the password in the `docker-compose.yml` file (in your case, it should be `304rootpw`).

Use these hints to review your Docker file and ensure you understand each section's purpose. If you have specific questions about any part, feel free to ask!",One thing I've noticed is that the path to `sqlcmd` isn't up-to-date. You can correct this by making the changes seen [here](https://github.com/bradanfleming/cosc_304/commit/b355287075e67c6960ecf8e61429280b2f4798b9) and recreating the containers (`docker compose down; docker compose up -d`).
59,Where can i find the prairielearn practice questions?,"You can find the PrairieLearn practice questions in the PrairieLearn platform itself. Make sure to check any announcements or resources provided by your instructor for specific links or instructions on accessing those questions. Additionally, reviewing your course materials and notes may also guide you on where to find practice questions.",All PL answers and answers in the notes are in the Modules section on Canvas. https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/150492/modules
60,Lab 5 Due date and Questions,"It sounds like there may be some confusion regarding the due dates and materials for Lab 5. I would recommend checking the official course syllabus or announcements for the most accurate due date, as that should clarify when Lab 5 is due. 

As for the questions, if you find discrepancies between GitHub and PrairieLearn, it might be best to confirm with your TA or instructor which set of questions you should focus on. They can provide the most reliable guidance.","Lab 5 is primarily on GitHub. PrairieLearn only contains the part of lab 5 involving the design. You need to complete all components of lab 5 as specified on GitHub.

Lab 5 is a two week lab from October 7 to 18th. Similar to other labs, it is due the following Friday which is October 25th. 10% bonus by Monday, October 21st and 5% bonus by Wednesday, October 23rd."
61,Follow up to lab8 login question,"It's great to hear that you've got the login feature working!

Just remember to refer back to the context provided, especially regarding form elements and security implementations.",Congratulations on getting the login feature working! Feel free to ask or join a help session if you have any other questions.
62,Lab 8 - troubles with login credentials for login.jsp on demo site. ,"It sounds like you're having trouble with the login process on the demo site. One thing to check is whether you're using the correct format for the username and password. 

Consider the following hints:
1. Make sure the username and password you are entering match the expected format and length specified in the form (8 characters max).
2. Look for any error messages that might provide clues about what's going wrong. Are you seeing any specific messages after attempting to log in?
3. Verify if you have the right credentials from the standard DDL, as sometimes they might differ from what you expect.

If you're still stuck, try resetting your input and ensuring there are no extra spaces or characters in your entries.","The username for the [sample website](https://cosc304.ok.ubc.ca/rlawrenc/tomcat/lab8/admin.jsp) is `arnold`, and the password is `test`."
63,hosting bug,"It sounds like you're facing challenges with your Docker setup on DigitalOcean. Here are a few hints that might help you troubleshoot:

1. **Firewall Rules**: Double-check that the firewall rules allow traffic on the ports used by your Docker containers. Ensure that the necessary ports are open for both incoming and outgoing traffic.

2. **Docker Compose**: After modifying the `docker-compose.yml` file, ensure that the changes are saved, and verify that you are in the correct directory when executing `docker-compose down` and `docker-compose up -d`.

3. **Logs**: Check the logs of your containers with `docker-compose logs` to see if there are any error messages that can guide you in resolving the issue.

4. **Networking**: Make sure the network settings in Docker are correctly configured to allow connections from outside the container.

5. **Documentation**: Refer to the DigitalOcean and Docker documentation for additional troubleshooting steps tailored to their platform.

If you follow these hints and still encounter issues, consider reaching out for specific help at the provided link for support.",Note that if you are trying to host on Digital Ocean that you need at least 2 GB of RAM. The lowest droplet of 1 GB will not run Microsoft SQL Server.
64,Hosting Solution that worked for me,"It's great to hear that enabling the TCP/IP option resolved your JDBC connection issue! For your assignment, think about how database hosting options might impact connectivity. How does the hosting environment (local, on-premise, or cloud) affect access and configuration? Consider discussing these aspects in your response.","Thank you for that item to check.

Here are other common issues:
1) Need at least 2 GB RAM if running on Digital Ocean.
2) Docker file may need modification (especially if you were running on Mac and changed the default SQL Server 2019 image).
3) Firewall issues.

Please stop by office hours on Friday for help if needed."
65,Hosting,"It sounds like you're encountering a permissions issue when trying to stop the container. Have you checked if you are running the command with the necessary privileges? You might need to prepend your command with `sudo` if you're on a Unix-like system. Additionally, ensure you are in the correct directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located when you run the `docker-compose up -d` command. This should help you manage your containers more effectively.","To work around this, you can either add yourself to the `docker` user group and log in again (e.g., `usermod -aG $USER docker`) or you can prefix the command with sudo. If the container is stopped, then you can remove it with `docker rm cosc304-mysql`."
66,Converting ER to Relational Final Exam,"It sounds like you're concerned about how your performance on the AutoER tool might affect your overall marks. A good hint here is to check the specific grading policy outlined by your instructor or course materials. Typically, instructors may allow for partial credit based on your own work, even if the AutoER tool did not yield a perfect score. It could be beneficial to ask for clarification on whether you will receive a new ER design or if your own conversion will be evaluated independently.",The question where you design an ER diagram using AutoER on PrairieLearn is separate from the question where you convert an ER diagram to the relational model. Your performance on the ER question has no impact on your ability to answer the convert to the relational model question.
67,Lab 10 Grading Template Inquiry,,"For any analysis you perform in lab 10, the ""overview of approach with assumptions"" item means that you should explain the high-level goal of what your analysis is trying to achieve and also any assumptions or constraints that affect that analysis. For example, if you were trying to predict the sales 4 years in advance, you may have assumptions that the sales data may be impacted by a growing economy which would result in a 5% boost or that the since you do not have the last few months of 2023 data that ""2023 data will be increased by 20% as there are still 2 months of sales."" We made this assumption on lab 8. There is no ""right"" answer on what the assumptions/constraints are, but as an analyst they should be reasonable/plausible based on what you are trying to achieve."
68,Notation Inquiry,"The notation ""π A(R)"" refers to the projection operator in relational algebra. It retrieves a set of tuples from relation R, but only includes the attributes specified in set A. Essentially, it filters the relation to show only the columns that are in A, discarding others.","The notation ""π A(R)"" refers to the projection operator in relational algebra. It retrieves a set of tuples from relation R, but only includes the attributes specified in set A. Essentially, it filters the relation to show only the columns that are in A, discarding others."
69,Lab 1 Question 3 Inquiry,"It seems you're experiencing issues with your SQL query in Lab 1. To improve your query's efficiency and ensure it runs correctly, consider the following suggestions:

1. **Check your Date Format**: Ensure that the date format you are using matches the format in your database.

2. **Simplify Conditions**: Instead of using multiple conditions, you could use a `BETWEEN` clause for the date range to make it more readable.

3. **Use Aliases for Clarity**: Adding aliases to your tables can help make the query easier to understand.

Here’s a refined version of your query:

```sql
SELECT p.pname, p.price, sp.amount
FROM Shipment s
JOIN ShippedProduct sp ON s.shipment_id = sp.shipment_id
JOIN Product p ON sp.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE s.shipdate BETWEEN '2012-06-01' AND '2014-12-21'
AND p.price < 40 
AND sp.amount > 4;
```

This version retains your original logic but simplifies the date condition and improves readability. If you continue to receive errors, double-check the table and column names for correctness.","The answer is correct. You can show the TA and he will mark it. Unfortunately, PrairieLearn will timeout some grading of questions if they take to long even if the answer is correct."
72,Lab 1 Question 3 Inquiry,"In your attempt to use dates in relational algebra, your syntax for the date comparison is close but needs clarification. The correct way to express the condition for the date range in relational algebra is to separate the comparisons with logical AND (∧) instead of trying to combine them in a single expression.

For your query, you should write:

\[ 
σ(Date('2012-06-01') < shipdate ∧ shipdate < Date('2014-12-21') ∧ price < 40 ∧ shipped\_amount > 4)(Products) 
\]

This ensures that each condition is applied correctly. Make sure you replace ""Products"" with the actual relation name you're working with. If you continue to face issues, check that the attribute names (like `shipdate`, `price`, and `shipped_amount`) are spelled correctly and match your schema.","In your attempt to use dates in relational algebra, your syntax for the date comparison is close but needs clarification. The correct way to express the condition for the date range in relational algebra is to separate the comparisons with logical AND (∧) instead of trying to combine them in a single expression.

\[ 
σ(Date('2012-06-01') < shipdate ∧ shipdate < Date('2014-12-21') ∧ price < 40 ∧ shipped\_amount > 4)(Shipment) 
\]

The key point is that you cannot make a condition like this:

Date('2012-06-01') < shipdate < Date('2014-12-21')

You must separate it into two conditions connected with an AND:

Date('2012-06-01') < shipdate AND shipdate < Date('2014-12-21')
"
73,Lab 1 Question 4 Inquiry,"The condition you provided, ""(σ((inventory*0.3)≤amount) (Product⨝ShippedProduct⨝Customer))"", may not work due to the following reasons:

1. **Data Type Issues**: Ensure that the 'inventory' and 'amount' fields are of compatible data types for comparison. If one is a string, the comparison may not execute as expected.

2. **Join Conditions**: Verify that the joins between the tables (Product, ShippedProduct, and Customer) are correctly set up. If the joins are not returning the expected rows, the condition may seem ignored.

3. **Filtering Logic**: The filtering condition may not yield any results if no records meet the criteria of having a shipment amount at least 30% of the current inventory. Check if there are rows in the joined dataset that satisfy this condition.

4. **Execution Environment**: Sometimes, the execution environment (such as SQLite in PrairieLearn) may have limitations or specific behaviors. Make sure that the database is set up correctly and that there are no issues with the query execution.

Review these points to troubleshoot why the condition appears to be ignored.","The condition you provided, ""(σ((inventory*0.3)≤amount) (Product⨝ShippedProduct⨝Customer))""

does not work because you are not joining with Shipment. There are no fields in common between ShippedProduct and Customer."
75,Lab 6 Return ResultSet Issue,"To return a `ResultSet` from your `query1()` method, you need to ensure that the `ResultSet` object is accessible outside the `try` block where it's created. One way to achieve this is to declare the `ResultSet` variable outside the `try` block. This way, you can return it after the `try-catch` structure.

Here's a hint on how to adjust your code:

1. Declare the `ResultSet` variable before the `try` block.
2. Initialize the `ResultSet` inside the `try` block.
3. Ensure that you're returning the `ResultSet` only after the `try` block, while managing any potential resource issues.

This approach will allow you to return the `ResultSet` as needed. Consider how to handle closing the `ResultSet` properly to avoid resource leaks.","You do not need a `try-catch` for `query1()`. Write your SQL, create a statement, execute your query and return the result like this:

```
String sql = ""SELECT ..."";
Statement stmt = con.createStatement();
return stmt.executeQuery(sql);    
```"
77,Help fixing docker,"It sounds like there might be an issue with your Docker container setup. Here are a few hints to help you troubleshoot:

1. **Check Dockerfile**: Ensure that the necessary tools are installed in your Docker image. The error suggests that `sqlcmd` is missing, which might indicate an incomplete installation.

2. **Inspect Docker Compose Configuration**: Look at your `docker-compose.yml` file for any misconfigurations that might prevent the tools from being installed correctly.

3. **Rebuild the Container**: Sometimes, rebuilding the container can resolve issues. You can try running `docker-compose down` followed by `docker-compose up --build`.

4. **Logs**: Check the logs for any errors during the startup process by running `docker-compose logs`.

If you still have issues, consider reaching out for more specific guidance based on your setup.","It seems that you're running `docker compose up` instead of `docker compose up -d`. In that case, the containers will run in the foreground, and it is expected for the command to not finish running.  
To fix the path error, you can update the `docker-compose.yml` file [like so](https://github.com/bradanfleming/cosc_304/commit/b355287075e67c6960ecf8e61429280b2f4798b9) and recreate the cosc304-sqlserver container. This should correct the paths and fix the auto-loading of the DDL. You may also choose to ignore them, create an empty `orders` database, and use the `loaddata` page to install the DDL.  
Note that these instructions will need to be adapted to the lab you're completing, and you'll need to use the original SQL Server image rather than Azure SQL Edge."
78,Are Live Assessments in PrairieLearn counted for marks?,"Yes, live questions in PrairieLearn are counted for marks as part of the overall quiz component, which contributes to 10% of your overall grade. The grading scheme includes points from live questions alongside Canvas quizzes and iClicker questions.","Yes, live questions in PrairieLearn are counted for marks.

The maximum is 10%. It is not possible to be higher than 10% for the quiz component.

There is no makeup for any of these quizzes since there are so many questions asked. Do NOT contact the instructor or TA if you miss a class or have technical problems with any of the systems. If you are participating regularly, there should be no problem in getting the 10% for quiz activity."
80,Midterm #1 Cutoff,"To find the cutoff for Midterm #1, you should review the lecture slide decks covered before that midterm. Pay attention to the dates and content of the lectures leading up to the midterm. Check your course schedule or announcements for any specific guidance on which slides are included.","As stated in the Canvas announcement describing the exam, the exam is up to and including SQL. There is nothing on DB design on midterm 1."
81,materials covered in Midterm#2,"For midterm #2, you might want to review the topics covered after midterm #1, as the exam will likely focus on that material. As for the format, think about the types of questions you've encountered in class and assignments—these often give a good indication of what to expect.

You can also check the Canvas announcements for more specific details as the exam date approaches.",See the post on Canvas for details.
82,Final Exam,"It sounds like you're preparing for your final exam. Based on the context provided, you might want to consider how the ER diagram and the relational schema conversion are related. 

Think about the process of converting an ER diagram into a relational schema—what steps you need to take and if they could be grouped as one question or if they might be assessed separately. 

To clarify, you should review the specific instructions for your final exam, as they usually outline the format of the questions. If you have any more specific questions about the content or process, feel free to ask!",The ER diagram is done on PrairieLearn. The convert ER to relational is on Canvas. They are separate questions.
83,Normalization Slide 31,"It sounds like you are encountering a common issue when normalizing to BCNF where dependencies keep affecting the keys. To address this, consider analyzing each functional dependency carefully. 

1. Identify the candidate keys for the schema.
2. Check each functional dependency against the candidate keys to determine if any violate BCNF.
3. When you find a violation, think about how to decompose the relation further.

For your specific case, focus on how the changes you make to the keys might affect other functional dependencies. Remember, the goal is to eliminate partial and transitive dependencies that lead to BCNF violations. 

Keep trying to break down the dependencies step by step!","On slide #31, performing the normalization of StudentCourse there are two candidate keys of that initial relation:

1) (sid, cnum)
2) (ssn, cnum)

You will get two different but equivalent answers if you either take fd2 or fd3 out first.

Remove fd2 first (as ssn is not a candidate key of StudentCourse):
Student (ssn {PK}, sid)
StudentCourse (ssn {PK}, cnum {PK}, grade)

Remove FD3 first:
Student (sid {PK}, ssn)
StudentCourse (sid {PK}, cnum, grade)

Both are equivalently correct according to normalization. 

Note that in either case once you remove the FD and separate into two relations that both fd2 and fd3 are satisfied because there are two candidate keys for student: 1) (sid)  2) (ssn)."
84,Practice 22.1: Normalization Q1,"To address your question about normalization and the attribute closure, consider the following hints:

1. **Attribute Closure**: When you compute the closure of a set of attributes (like G in your case), think about how that closure relates to the functional dependencies you have. It helps to identify which attributes can be derived from others.

2. **Determining Relations**: When normalizing to BCNF, ensure that every functional dependency satisfies the condition that the left-hand side is a superkey. If you find any violations, you may need to decompose the relations further.

3. **Final Relation Count**: After normalization, list all the relations you’ve obtained and count them. Each relation will represent a unique set of attributes that satisfy BCNF.

Keep these points in mind while you analyze your schema and functional dependencies. If you need more guidance, think about the implications of each functional dependency and how they relate to your relations!","I am not sure what question you are referring too.

In short, yes you remove all attributes in the closure and leave the LHS in the relation in order to allow a later join.

However, it's a good practice to manage them to avoid confusion and free up space. You may want to check the lab instructions for any specific recommendations regarding cleanup.  
In addition, DDL is often loaded when the container is started. If your lab depends on the database being initialized a certain way (e.g., Lab 6), it's usually easier to just delete and re-create a container (e.g., cosc304-mysql) than it is to manually load a lab's DDL."
86,Naming fields in Lab 2,"In Lab 2, it’s generally a good practice to follow the naming conventions provided in your assignment. This ensures consistency and clarity in your database. However, if the instructions allow for flexibility in naming, you can choose names like ""aname"" and ""iname"" as long as they are clear and meaningful.

88,Lab 8,"It sounds like you may have encountered issues with your connections after pushing your changes to GitHub. Here are some hints to help you troubleshoot:

1. **Check Database Connection**: Ensure that your database connection settings in your PHP code are still correct after the changes. 

2. **Review Your Code**: Look for any changes you made when adding Git that might have affected your database connection (e.g., file paths or configuration settings).

3. **Error Messages**: Pay attention to any error messages that appear when you try to connect. They can give you clues about what might be wrong.

4. **Local Environment**: Make sure your local environment is set up correctly, especially if you're using Docker for database deployment.

5. **GitHub Settings**: If you are using GitHub Pages or similar, ensure that your server setup matches the requirements for connecting to your database.

Try these steps, and if you're still having issues, consider reaching out for more specific help based on the errors you encounter.","Interesting — creating a git repository shouldn't have done that.  
I would recommend checking Docker and ensuring that all containers are running. You can also check the `cosc304-sqlserver` logs to see if there are any authentication issues. Also ensure that you connect to `cosc304_sqlserver` rather than `localhost` from within the container — Docker containers won't have access to servers on your host network. You can also run `docker compose up --force-recreate` to force Docker to recreate the Docker network if necessary.

2. **Database Connection**: Ensure that you are connecting to the correct database instance. You might want to verify the container is running properly with `docker-compose ps`.

3. **User Permissions**: If you are trying to use 'sa', ensure that this user is correctly set up in your MySQL database. You might want to connect as 'root' and check user privileges.

4. **Logs**: Check the logs of your MySQL container for any error messages that could provide more information on the connection failure. You can do this by running `docker logs <container_name>`.

If you follow these steps, you should be able to identify the issue. Good luck!","This most likely occurred because the DDL for the `orders` database wasn't loaded properly. When you attempt to log into a non-existent database, MS SQL Server generally displays it as an authentication error. You can confirm that this is the case by viewing the Docker logs for `cosc304-sqlserver`.

To fix this, you can apply the DDL manually using the instructions in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT3v29Zg5IQ&list=PLNy6MJ_mI2wVhDpCnJNWdBIOmXXmcR3i_&index=4). You can also try updating the docker-compose.yml file [like so](https://github.com/bradanfleming/cosc_304/commit/b355287075e67c6960ecf8e61429280b2f4798b9) and recreating the cosc304-mysql container. Note that both of these will need to be adapted to Lab 7 (e.g., load orders instead of workson).

If none of that works, I would recommend joining a virtual help session — we might be able to figure out the problem."
98,Lab 5 - ER diagram state,"To determine if you can revert to a previous state of your ER diagrams in PL, you might want to check if the platform has a version control feature or an autosave function. Look for any documentation or help sections that mention history or version management. This could provide you with the information you need.",It is not possible to revert to a previous ER diagram in PL.
99,Python packages for midterm,,It would be okay to use a different Python mysql package for the midterm exam.
101,Lab 7,"It sounds like you’re facing multiple issues with your assignments. Here are some hints to help you troubleshoot each problem:

1. **NodeJS Connection Error**: The error message indicates a permissions issue. Double-check the user credentials and permissions in your database setup. Make sure the user `sa` has the necessary permissions for the database you're trying to access.

2. **PHP Docker Container**: If the PHP container is stuck on ""exited,"" check the logs for any error messages. You can view the logs by running `docker-compose logs [service_name]`. This can give you clues about what might be going wrong.

3. **Java Loaddata File**: If the JSP file is displaying as text, ensure that your server is correctly configured to handle JSP files. Check that your web server (like Tomcat) is running properly and that your deployment settings are correct.

Remember to verify your Docker setup and configurations for each environment as well. Good luck!","If the connection is failing in all containers, it is most likely because the `orders` database does not exist. You can confirm this by reading the docker logs for the cosc304-sqlserver container.  
If this is the case, you can install the DDL manually by following the instructions in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT3v29Zg5IQ&list=PLNy6MJ_mI2wVhDpCnJNWdBIOmXXmcR3i_&index=4).

102,8 November class recording,"It seems like you're experiencing an issue with accessing the class recording for November 8. Have you checked if there's a specific announcement or an update in Canvas regarding that recording? Sometimes, recordings may be posted later or there could be technical issues. You might also want to reach out to your instructor or tech support for assistance.",The lecture for November 7th in now posted.
103,Topics included in the final,"In the context of the final exam review, it's important to focus on the topics that have been explicitly covered throughout the course. While hosting, data warehousing, and transactions are mentioned, you might want to double-check the course outline or your notes to identify the key topics that are emphasized for the final exam. Consider what has been highlighted during your recent classes and project presentations, as those may provide clues about what to focus on for the exam.","Topics such as data warehousing, transactions, hosting, and other smaller topics may be in multiple choice or smaller questions but are not one of the large questions explicitly mentioned that will be on the exam."
104,Relational Algebra Practice Lab1 Q.8,"To find all authors who have written more than one book using relational algebra, you can follow these steps:

1. **Select all rows from the authors' books relation** (assuming the relation is named `Books` with attributes `Author` and `Book`).
2. **Group by Author** and count the number of books for each author.
3. **Select authors with a count greater than 1**.

Here’s a sample relational algebra expression:

1. **Group and count**:
   \[
   G = \gamma_{Author, COUNT(Book) \rightarrow BookCount}(Books)
   \]

2. **Select** authors with more than one book:
   \[
   Result = \sigma_{BookCount > 1}(G)
   \]

This would give you the authors who have written more than one book. The specific syntax may vary based on your database system, but the concept remains the same.","To find all authors who have written more than one book using relational algebra without using a GROUP BY operator, join the BookAuthor relation with itself on (firstName, lastName) and the ISBNs are not the same.

105,Issue with coding space of lab practice,"The error in your query may stem from the use of the assignment operator (←) instead of the correct syntax for your database interaction in R or SQL. Make sure you are using the appropriate functions for querying and assigning results in your specific programming environment. If you're using R, you may want to use the `dplyr` package to handle such queries.","For assignment in PrairieLearn and ReLaX editor, use the = sign not ←.
Example:
result = π Book.isbn (Book)

106,Solution for LV 14.8,"To analyze the provided SQL query, consider the following hints:

1. **EXCEPT Clause**: The `EXCEPT` operator is used to return rows from the first query that are not present in the second query. Make sure that both queries have the same number of columns and compatible data types.

2. **Join Logic**: In your first query, you're joining the `emp` table to itself using `supereno` and `eno`. This part seems correct if you're trying to find employees supervised by someone.

3. **Second Query**: The second part of the query involves a join between the `emp` and `dept` tables. Check if the column you're selecting (`ename`) from the second query matches the column type of the first query.

4. **Column Alignment**: Ensure that both selected columns (from the first and second query) are the same in terms of their data type and structure.

5. **Purpose**: Think about the logic of what you want to achieve. Are you trying to find employees who are supervised but not managers? Clarifying your intent might help refine the query.

By reviewing these points, you should be able to identify what might be wrong with your query and how to fix it.","Your answer is correct. An issue with the auto-grade was resolved.

107,Question regarding lab 1 q4,"To address the issue with your query, ensure that the condition for filtering based on the state and amount is correctly applied. According to your context, it seems you want to exclude any results that do not meet the criteria of `amount` being greater than 30% of `inventory` specifically for each state.

You might want to adjust your query to ensure the logical conditions are correctly structured. Instead of using an OR (`∨`), use an AND (`∧`) to ensure that the condition applies to each state separately. Here’s a refined approach:

```sql
SELECT pname, inventory, amount, state
FROM Product
JOIN ShippedProduct ON Product.id = ShippedProduct.product_id
JOIN Customer ON ShippedProduct.customer_id = Customer.id
JOIN Shipment ON ShippedProduct.shipment_id = Shipment.id
WHERE amount >= (0.3 * inventory)
AND state IN ('CA', 'IA')
```

This query will return products where the `amount` is greater than or equal to 30% of `inventory` and is limited to the states of California (CA) and Iowa (IA). If you still see unexpected results, double-check your data for any entries that might not meet your expectations.","You need to group the OR clause with parenthesis due to order of operations.

πpname,inventory,amount,state σ amount ≥ (0.3*inventory) ∧ (state='CA'∨ state='IA') (Product⨝ShippedProduct⨝Customer⨝Shipment)

109,Squirrel Setup,"It sounds like you're on the right track, but the JDBC URL you used might be the issue. In your case, ensure that the URL is correctly formatted. It should specify the database you want to connect to in the format: `jdbc:mysql://server/database?user=username`. 

Since you're trying to access the `testDB`, your URL should look something like `jdbc:mysql://localhost/testDB?user=test`. Make sure you replace ""localhost"" with the actual server address if needed, and check that your database name is correct. This should help you see the tables in SQuirreL.","In SQuirreL, you can select the database to use by clicking on the drop down menu by Catalog: and selecting the database that you want to use."
110,Lab 6 Setup,"It seems you are experiencing a connection issue with the database. Here are a few hints to troubleshoot the problem:

1. **Check Database Credentials**: Ensure that the username and password are indeed correct for the database. Sometimes, small typographical errors can lead to connection failures.

2. **Database URL**: Verify that the URL `jdbc:mysql://localhost/WorksOn` is correct. It should point to the right database server and database name.

3. **User Privileges**: Make sure that the user has the necessary permissions to access the `WorksOn` database.

4. **MySQL Server Status**: Ensure that the MySQL server is running and accessible on localhost.

5. **JDBC Driver**: Confirm that you have the correct JDBC driver for MySQL included in your project.

By checking these areas, you should be able to identify the source of the connection issue.","This usually means that you have a separate MySQL server running on your computer (i.e., if you had to change your port from 3306 to 3307 in docker-compose.yml). If this is the case, make sure you're connecting to the right URI (jdbc:mysql://localhost__:3307__/workson),

If that doesn't correct the issue, I'd recommend joining a help session so we can debug the issue in real-time."
